# script-ware-script-dumper

Outputs to a folder under Script-Ware's workspace folder which is named the game's name with "'s Script Dumper Output" appended to the end.

Due to a bug with disassemble which is now known to the developers of Script-Ware, you may experience crashes after saving 40-60+ scripts. 
This is something I have no control over, and I will ensure a fix will come eventually.
